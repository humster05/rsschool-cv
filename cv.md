### Briefly about myself
I am a graduate of the Faculty of Engineering (Department of Ecology) at the Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University. In my last year of study, while writing my thesis, I studied topics related to the chemical composition of apple trees, as well as the release of various pollutants into the atmosphere at various theoretical temperatures. During the 4 years of study, we studied various environmental problems and ways to solve them, but as always, theory does not play any role without practice.
